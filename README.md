# codonAutocorrelation
Compute codon autocorrelation 

## What is included
- Sets of scripts to analyze codon autocorrelation in fasta sequences
- Outputs 3 types of measurements: number of standard deviations from expected, effect vector and  relative synonymous codon pair usage (RSCPU)

## How to run the software

###Â STEP 1: Download genome CDS fasta sequences
You can get them, for example, from EMBL CDS database:
